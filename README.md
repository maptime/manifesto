manifesto
=========

IN-PROGRESS - a repo for creating our mission statement. 

The original mission statement – created by @almccon, @bethschechter, and @camilleanne – can be found here:

@lyzidiamond also collected some great ideas about what maptime is and what Maptime isn't at the 2014 State of the Map. 

Now that we've grown, it's time to create a manifesto. 

More info coming shortly...
